The Large Hadron Collider had switched off its operation for 2 years (2019 until 2021) for upgrading, in order to increase the offered instantaneous luminosity. Part of the Muon Spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment, especially the previous Small Wheels, was replaced by 2 New Small Wheels as a means to cope with the new conditions. Inside the New Small Wheels, new detectors have been mounted called Micromegas. In the following thesis, after the description of the ATLAS experiment and then of the New Small Wheels and Micromegas, a study based on simulated data will presented concerning the efficiency and the unassociated hit multiplicity of the detectors. The studies were performed as a function of the detectors geometry.
