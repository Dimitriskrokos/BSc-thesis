From 2019 to 2021, the LHC upgraded to boost luminosity, leading to the replacement of ATLAS's Small Wheels with New Small Wheels (NSWs) featuring Micromegas detectors. This thesis focuses on a study using simulated data to assess the efficiency and unassociated hit multiplicity of these detectors, based on their geometry.
